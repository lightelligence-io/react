## Description 

The `BasicDataCardsContent` component contains the content node of a `BasicDataCardsItem`. Usually a `BasicDataCardsitem` has only one content child, but it is possible to provide one for table mode `tableOnly` and another one for `listMode`.

Take a look at [the examples of BasicDataCards](#/Components/BasicDataCards) to see usage of this component in context.
