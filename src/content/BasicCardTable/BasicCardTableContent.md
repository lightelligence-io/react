## Description

The `BasicCardTableContent` component contains the content node of a `BasicCardTableItem`. Usually a `BasicCardTableitem` has only one content child, but it is possible to provide one for table mode `tableOnly` and another one for `listMode`.

Take a look at [the examples of BasicCardTable](#/Components/BasicCardTable) to see usage of this component in context.
